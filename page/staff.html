<div class="container"><strong>SOME KEY ASPECT OF OUR APPROACH TO WORKING WITH CLIENTS</strong></div>
<div class="container">Therapists at Resolve integrate a number of therapeutic techniques largely based on the presenting problem of the client.&nbsp; However, the primary approach of most Resolve therapists is one based on Rational-Emotive/Cognitive Behavioral.&nbsp; Below is a summary of the distinctive aspects of the methodology.</div>
<div class="container">
<ol type="A">
<li>The de-emphasis of early childhood is paramount. While CBT/REBT accepts the fact that dysfunctional emotional states are sometimes originally learned or aggravated by early teaching or irrational beliefs taught during development.&nbsp; It proposes that these early-acquired irrationalities are not automatically sustained over the years by themselves.&nbsp; Instead, people must actively and creatively re-instill them t. Consequently the CB/REBT usually spends very little time on the clients’ parents or family upbringing; but is fully able to them to bring about significant changes in their problems with life. The therapist demonstrates that no matter what the clients’ basic irrational philosophy of life, nor when and how they acquired it, they are presently disturbed because they still believe this self-defeating world- and self-view. If they will observe exactly what they are irrationally thinking in the present, and will challenge and question these self-statements they will usually improve significantly.</li>
<li>Emphasis on deep philosophical change and scientific thinking. Because of its belief that human neurotic disturbance is largely ideologically or philosophically based, CBT/REBT strives for a thorough-going philosophic reorientation of a people’s outlook on life, rather than for a mere removal of any of their mental or psychosomatic symptoms. It teaches the clients, for ex ample, that human adults do not need to be accepted or loved, even though it is highly desirable that they be. REBT encourages individuals to be healthily sad or regretful when they are rejected, frustrated, or deprived. But it tries to teach them how to overcome feelings of intense hurt, self-deprecation, and depression. As in science, clients are shown how to question the dubious hypotheses that they construct about themselves and others. If they believe (as alas, millions of us do), that they are worthless because they perform certain acts badly, they are not merely taught to ask, “What is really bad about my acts?” and “Where is the evidence that they are wrong or unethical?” More importantly, they are shown how to ask themselves, “Granted that my acts may be mistaken, why am I a totally bad person for performing them? Where is the evidence that I must always be right in order to consider my-self worthy? Assuming that it is preferable for me to act well rather than badly, why do I have to do what is preferable?”Similarly, when people perceive (let us suppose, correctly) the erroneous and unjust acts of others, and become enraged at these others, they are shown how to stop and ask themselves, “Why is my hypothesis that the people who committed these errors and injustices are no damned good a true hypothesis? Granted that it would be better if they acted more competently or fairly, why should they have to do what would be better?” CBT/REBT helps clients understand that their demands and judgments of others is the basis of anger and conflict – not merely a result of the action of those who offend.</li>
<li>CBT/REBT teaches that to be human is to be fallible, and that if we are to get on in life with minimal upset and discomfort, we would better accept this reality — and then unanxiously work hard to become a little less fallible.</li>
<li>Use of psychological homework. CBT/ REBT agrees with most psychodynamic,&nbsp; Freudian, neo-Freudian, Adlerian, and Jungian schools that acquiring insight, especially so-called emotional insight, into the source of their neurosis is a most important part of people’s corrective teaching. It distinguishes sharply, however, between so-called intellectual and emotional insight, and operationally defines emotional insight as individuals’ knowing or seeing the cause of their problems and working, in a determined and energetic manner, to apply this knowledge to the solution of these problems. The rational emotive behavior therapist helps clients to acknowledge that there is usually no other way for him to get better but by their continually observing, questioning, and challenging their own belief-systems, and by their working and practicing to change their own irrational beliefs by verbal and behavioral counter-propagandizing activity. In REBT, actual homework assignments are frequently agreed upon in individual and group therapy. Assignments may include dating a person whom the client is afraid to ask for a date; looking for a new job; experimentally returning to live with a husband with whom one has previously continually quarrelled; etc. The therapist quite actively tries to encourage clients to undertake such assignments as an integral part of the therapeutic process.The REBT/CBT practitioner is able to give clients unconditional rather than conditional positive regard because the REBT philosophy holds that no humans are to be damned for anything, no matter how execrable their acts may be. Because of the therapist’s unconditional acceptance of them as a human, and actively teaching clients how to fully accept themselves, clients are able to express their feelings more openly and to stop rating themselves even when they acknowledge the inefficiency or immorality of some of their acts.In many highly important ways, then, rational emotive behavior therapy utilizes expressive-experimental methods and behavioral techniques. It is not, however, primarily interested in helping people ventilate emotion and feel better, but in showing them how they can truly get better, and lead to happier, non-self-defeating, self-actualized lives.</li>

<p>In light of the recent developments with the <strong>COVID-19</strong> pandemic, Resolve Community Counseling Center is discontinuing in-person counseling sessions as of <strong>Monday, March 23, 2020</strong> until further notice. We are pleased to announce, however, that there will be no interruption of services to our clients! All sessions will be conducted through tele-therapy.  These services are confidential and safe.  Office staff will continue to respond to <strong>phone calls (908 322 9180)</strong> and emails <a href="mailto:Resolve@ResolveNJ.com">resolve@resolvenj.com</a>. Our intake process is very similar to our in person process. We have a large, qualified and caring clinical staff here to address the mental health needs of the community. If you need help or know someone who is lonely or in need of support, please reach out to us.  </p>
